<h3>A bizzare but tasty combination</h3>
<p>I've been dreaming of making this Cheeseburger Pizza for months! I've combined two of my favorites into one, out of this world party food!</p>

<p>Don’t reserve this pizza just for parties though, it’s also perfectly acceptable for any day of the week.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough (such as Pillsbury®)</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>⅛ cup prepared yellow mustard</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup chopped dill pickles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray; unroll pizza dough over the baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook and stir beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Mix mayonnaise and mustard together in a small bowl. Spread over the parbaked crust. Layer beef-onion mixture, Cheddar cheese, and pickles on top.</li>
    <li>Return to the oven and bake until crust is dark golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes.</li>
